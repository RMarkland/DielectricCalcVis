# DielectricCalcVis
Code for handling C/V (Capacitance-Voltage) readings, calculating dielectric values of material, and organsing calculated values based on naming system of files.
Handles large amounts of data - dozens of scans with thousands of points - in order to calculate dielectric constants.

Takes in .txt files with specific naming system, purpose crafted for material analysis.
